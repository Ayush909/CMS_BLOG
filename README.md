<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://hidden-chamber-48931.herokuapp.com)

Blogging might be a way you express yourself, your interests, hobbies, beliefs, etc. Furthermore, you can make a living from it. Whatever the reason, you want your blog to be built on a platform that comes with lots of advantages, provides many possibilities, and suits all your needs. Considering the fact that there is a vast amount of CMS platforms, it is really tough to make the decision. That is what I was thought when I stumbled upon an idea to build a custom CMS from scratch.


Of course, this project may not have all the features just yet. But I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue.
